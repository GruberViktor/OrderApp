        Kansui is a very alkaline substance, 
        you need to be careful handling it. That is also the reason why there are so many 
        warnings on the bag.
        Wash your hands immediately after handling it. 
        (in order to avoid rubbing your eyes with Kansui-fingers!)
        We don't want anyone to hurt themselves with things that we sell, which is why we
        write so many warnings :)
