        Each bag of Koji spores is enough for 5 kg of cooked substrate. 
        Compared to other vendors, our spores are very concentrated. 
        For that reason it is recommended to dilute them, so you can handle them better.

        It’s best to mix them with any kind of starch, or with toasted flour - toasting is important to sterilize the flour. With starch that's not necessary.<br>
        I recommend using 29 g of starch per sachet, so together with the spores it’s going to be about 30 g, which makes the spores easier to handle and measure.

        Thus, for 0.5 kg of steamed rice you use 3 g of your mixture, for 1 kg you use 6 g.

        The mixture is best stored dry and dark, slightly below room temperature, but it's also OK to store it in the fridge.
        If your spores pass the best before date, just use a bit more of them. 
        They don’t go bad, they just lose a bit of their viabiliy.

        You may have seen it already, we have an article on our site on how to create the conditions Koji likes to grow in, and how to achieve them.
