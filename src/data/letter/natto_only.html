        The Natto starter should be diluted with any kind of starch, to make the spores easier to handle.
        I recommend to add about 10 g of starch, so that 2 g of your mix is enough for 1 kg of cooked beans.

        Here is a short write-up of how to use these spores. If you prefer something more visual, YouTube has plenty of videos on the topic. Just search for "How to make Natto".
        <ol>
            <li>Dilute your spores as indicated above.</li>
            <li>Soak your beans for 12h.</li>
            <li>Pressure steam your beans for 35 min (small variety) to 45 min (big variety). If you don't have a pressure steamer, steam them normally for 1.5 h, until they can be easily squeezed between your fingers.</li>
            <li>For every kg of steamed beans, use 2 g of the spores/starch mixture. Dilute your starter in a little bit of water.</li>
            <li>Mix the hot, steamed beans with the starter and transfer to a pyrex dish or something similar. Try to get the depth of the beans to around 2.3 cm. If you make it thicker, you risk overheating.</li>
            <li>Put plastic film or aluminum foil over your dish. Poke some holes into the film/foil.</li>
            <li>Keep your beans at 41Â°C for 20h.</li>
            <li>After 20h, your Natto should be ready.</li>
        </ol>
        Transfer your Natto to the fridge. It will keep for about 4 weeks.
