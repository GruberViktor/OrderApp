        The dried koji rice has been carefully dried at 45째C, and should still have (close to) full enzymatic potential.
        To make miso with it, we recommend to grind it into a powder in a mixer. If you are following a recipe for miso
        which calls for fresh koji, you can assume that 1 kg of dry koji is the same as 1.4 kg of fresh koji. 
        That means one 500 g package of dried koji has the same content of enzymes and nutrients (minus the water) 
        as 700 g of fresh koji. (500 g * 1.4 = 700 g)
    </p>
    <p>
        To reconstitute the koji, you can mix the powder with 200 g of water. (700 g - 500 g = 200 g) Then you can proceed to use it in a miso.
        If your miso seems way too dry, you can still add some more water. 
        (But beware, miso becomes more liquid over the course of fermentation! It's better to stay on the dry side.)

        To make amazake, simply mix 1 part rice koji with 2 parts (by weight) of water.
        Keep this mixture for about 2-3h at a temperature of at least 60째C, but not above 68-70째C, because otherwise you'll denature the enzymes.
        Be sure to not fall below 60째C, because otherwise you'll have all sorts of bacteria growing!
        That also means you should try to get your mix to this temperature quite quickly, not over the span of hours. <br>
        Amazake is great with a little bit of ginger added.
