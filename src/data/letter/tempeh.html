        The Tempeh spores, unlike our Koji spores, don't need to be diluted, since they are mixed with rice flour already.
        If you are just starting out, I recommend to start with 2 g of tempeh starter per kg of cooked beans. 
        Then, when you are getting better with tempeh, you can reduce the amount of starter to 1 g per kg.<br>
        I haven't written a how-to for tempeh yet, sorry for that. Until then, you will find plenty of good tutorials when googling for them :)
