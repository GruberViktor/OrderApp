        The Natto starter, like the Koji spores, should also be diluted for better handling. 
        I recommend to add about 10 g of starch, so that 2 g of your mix is enough for 1 kg of cooked beans.

        I wrote a concise step-by-step instructions in the description section of the natto spores in our shop.
        If you prefer something more visual, YouTube has plenty of videos on the topic. 
        Just search for “How to make Natto”, and you will find a wealth of good tutorials.
