    poppyseed miso is great together with preserved lemons (or lemon zest) in a sauce for pasta ;) <br>
    We like to lightly saut√© some white onion in a mix of butter and olive oil, 
    add some poppyseed miso, the lemons, and a crushed glove of garlic. 
    Immediately after that, bind the sauce with the cooking water of the noodles, just ladle it in and let it reduce. 
    When your noodles are al-dente, mix them into your sauce and enjoy with some parmesan :)<br>
    (Cook the noodles without salt, otherwise your sauce will be too salty)
